## My process
 -I arranged everything in order with HTML first
 -Then I styled the page with CSS
 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
 This is my first project with frontend mentor. It was a great learning as I got to implement whatever I learnt. This project helps my confidence as a website developer..
 
 -I learned grid in this project
 -how to use grid in the display attribute
 -grid-template-columns is another attribute I learnt which shapes the grid columns
 -I learnt to center objects with position attribute
 
### Continued development
The concepts which I am not fully understand are :

-position (absolute, relative)
-display 
-transform

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://github.com/orafaeloliveira/product-preview-card-component-main) - This helped me to complete my project. Things like how to center, how to use absolute and relative positioning, gave me a different method of solving the project.
